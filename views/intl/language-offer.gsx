// LanguageOffer offers this page in the reader's own language, written in that language, on every page until they
// choose one: the language they chose, or the one their browser asks for, when the site has it and the page is in
// another (intl.Suggested). A link, never a redirect, so search engines still reach every language version. "No
// thanks" (intl.Decline) keeps the page's language as their choice. Nothing renders when there is nothing to offer.
// Extra attributes fall through to the alert.
//
// From go tool intl add language-offer: the app's own now, to change as it likes.
