// Package ui is intl's own screens, which go tool intl add copies into an app the way gsxui add copies components: the
// language list, the offer of the page in the reader's language, and the time zone and clock dialog. Each is a gsx
// template made of gsxui components (*.gsx.tmpl: gsx generate leaves them alone here), and their text is already
// translated, in locales/: add writes it into the app's catalogs under [intl], with the text the gsxui components
// write themselves under [gsxui]. They are a registry (intl/registry), as gsxkit's components are.
